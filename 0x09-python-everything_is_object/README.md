0x09. Python - Everything is object
Foundations > Higher-level programming > Python

This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), then take the time to think and brainstorm with your peers about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.

Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:

How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script? (106-line2.txt)
After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt)
After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (106-line5.txt)
File(s): 106-line1.txt 106-line2.txt 106-line3.txt 106-line4.txt 106-line5.txt
