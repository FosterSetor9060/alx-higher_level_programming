How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
What ORM means
How to map a Python

Write a python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base():

State class:
inherits from Base Tips
links to the MySQL table states
class attribute id that represents a column of an auto-generated, unique integer, can’t be null and is a primary key
class attribute name that represents a column of a string with maximum 128 characters and can’t be null
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
WARNING: all classes who inherit from Base must be imported before calling Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

7. All states via SQLAlchemy
mandatory
Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

8. First state
mandatory
Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
The state you display must be the first in states.id
You are not allowed to fetch all states from the database before displaying the result
The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
If the table states is empty, print Nothing followed by a new line
Your code should not be executed when imported

9. Contains `a`
mandatory
Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

10. Get a state
mandatory
Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name to search (SQL injection free)
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
You can assume you have one record with the state name to search
Results must display the states.id
If no state has the name you searched for, display Not found
Your code should not be executed when imported

11. Add a new state
mandatory
Write a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Print the new states.id after creation
Your code should not be executed when imported

12. Update a state
mandatory
Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Change the name of the State where id = 2 to New Mexico
Your code should not be executed when imported

13. Delete states
mandatory
Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Your code should not be executed when imported

14. Cities in state
mandatory
Write a Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City.

City class:
inherits from Base (imported from model_state)
links to the MySQL table cities
class attribute id that represents a column of an auto-generated, unique integer, can’t be null and is a primary key
class attribute name that represents a column of a string of 128 characters and can’t be null
class attribute state_id that represents a column of an integer, can’t be null and is a foreign key to states.id
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
Next, write a script 14-model_city_fetch_by_state.py that prints all City objects from the database hbtn_0e_14_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module SQLAlchemy
You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
Results must be display as they are in the example below (<state name>: (<city id>) <city name>)
Your code should not be executed when imported.
