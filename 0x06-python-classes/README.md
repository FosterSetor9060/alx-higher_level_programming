0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

Overview
Welcome to the Python project focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this project, you will explore the fundamental concepts of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. The tasks will guide you through creating a class called Square and gradually adding features to it.

Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to:

Understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming.
Define and use classes and objects in Python.
Recognize the importance of encapsulation and access control (public, protected, private attributes).
Implement methods within a class to perform specific actions.
Utilize properties, getters, and setters to control attribute access.
Apply validation to ensure the correctness of attribute values.
Demonstrate knowledge of class inheritance.
Overload operators for custom behavior in class instances.
